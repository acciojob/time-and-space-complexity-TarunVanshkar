	<p>
		<b>Time complexity </b> The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the 
		amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length 
		of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of
		the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the 
		algorithm is running on. Itis a efficient way of calculating time of a program.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space complexity </b> Problem-solving using computer requires memory to 
		hold temporary data or final result while the program is in execution. The 
		amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called 
		<b>Space Complexity</b> of the algorithm. For many inputs, constant c is 
		insignificant, and it can be said that the space complexity is O(n).
